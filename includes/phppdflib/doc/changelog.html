<h1>History of changes</h1>
<h2>2.8</h2>
<p>2004-03-24</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to the importer (still experimental)  It should actually run without
    errors now, although it still doesn't do anything useful.
<li>Improved error handling of ->strlen().
<li>Added missing character widths.
</ul>
<h2>2.7</h2>
<p>2004-01-07</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of the (experimental) importer extension.
<li>Fixed print_r() problems that were causing errors in older versions of PHP.
</ul>
<h2>2.6</h2>
<p>2003-12-08</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ->debug and ->dbs and documentation to improve transparency.
<li>Added initial (experimental) packer extension.
<li>Removed documentation for obsolete functions ... I don't think anyone is
    using a 1.x version anymore.
</ul>
<h2>2.5</h2>
<p>2003-08-29</p>
<ul>
<li>Added png_embed()
<li>Altered sprintf() statements to work around a bug in php 4.3.2.
    This does not appear to degrade functionality with other versions
    of php.
</ul>
<h2>2.4</h2>
<p>2003-07-05</p>
<ul>
<li>The status of the 2.x series has been upgraded to stable.
<li>Fixed bug in ->template->place() where the string '0' would not
    be placed.
<li>Improved ->enable() to allow generalized extensions to be written
    without hacking phppdflib.class.php.  Added documentation on
    extension writing.
</ul>
<h2>2.3</h2>
<p>2003-06-05</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated documentation on headers and troubleshooting.
<li>Added hex triplet support to ->get_color().
<li>Pages now remember the margins they were created with and objects
    painted to a page use the page's margins, not the current default.
<li>->strlen() now uses default values if not specified.
<li>->strlen() now deals with tabs gracefully.
<li>Template example script now has more interesting examples.
<li>Overall documenatation audit and update.
<li>->pop_error() now returns false if there are no messages on the stack
<li>->template->place() now returns false if any errors are encountered
    during template placement, including overflow of pfields.
</ul>
<h2>2.2</h2>
<p>2003-05-07</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed logic error in right/center alignment for paragraphs
    (merged from 1.17).
<li>Fixed text encoding problem so non-US characters will display
    (merged from 1.17).
<li>Correct scale/rotation error in example.php when calling image_place()
    (Calling syntax has changed to be consistent with other functions)
<li>Added examples of place_circle() in example.php
<li>changed enable_chart() to enable('chart')
<li>Added template exension, documentation, and example file.
</ul>
<h2>1.17</h2>
<p>2003-02-09</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed logic error in right/center alignment for paragraphs.
<li>Fixed text encoding problem so non-US characters will display.
<li>Fixed bug where creating a PDF with no images or fonts created a corrupt
    resource dictionary (merged from 2.1).
<li>More isset()s to remove "undefined index" warnings.
<li>Fixed broken example-columns.php.
</ul>
<h2>2.1</h2>
<p>2003-02-03</p>
<ul>
<li>Noteworthy documentation additions (basics and bug-reporting
    sections).
<li>Updated example files so they work correctly with API
    changes.
<li>Lots of work done to get the defaults system actually
    working as one would expect it to.
<li>Fixed bug where a PDF with no images and no fonts would
    generate a corrupt resource dictionary
<li>Bug in compression logic resolved.
<li>There are now seperate parameters for text drawing mode
    ('tmode') and shape drawing mode ('smode').  Setting 'mode'
    sets both parameters.
<li>Many, many changes to remove Notices when php runs with
    error reporting set to E_ALL (don't know if I've got them all yet).
<li>Initial version of the charting interface added, this is very
    experimental at this time. I'm open to feedback!
<li>A new, spiffier method for specifying colors has been implemented.
    The ->get_color() method was created as a result.
<li>Moved examples to examples directory and modified as needed.
<li>Glyph widths moved to strlen.inc.php to reduce footprint when
    strlen() is not used (conditionally included).
<li>Unused parameter removed from ->_streamify() and ->_makedictionary().
</ul>
<h2>2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added draw_circle()
<li>Default system added, all functions should fall back to user-defined defaults if
a parameter was not specified. The set_default() function was added.
<li>Added basic error reporting: added error_array() and pop_error().
<li>Removed image_raw_place().
<li>Level 9 compression is now the default.
<li>Removed set_compress(), compression is now set by generate().
<li>Removed all band and column functions.
<li>General code cleanup and reorg: some functions were de-functionalized and added inline to the
generate process.
</ul>
<h2>1.16</h2>
<ul>
<li>Further improved <code>strlen</code> performance (less than 1%).
</ul>
<h2>1.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replace depreciated &$ function calls.
<li>Added isset() checks to remove warnings.
<li>When compression is enabled, <b>all</b> streams are compressed, even if another filter (such as /DCTEncode) had previously been applied - previously, only unfilter streams were compressed. This reduces file sizes in files with embedded JFIF (jpeg) images.
<li>word_wrap() function fixed.
<li>Added 'align' to parameters for paragraph placement.
<li>Changed text encoding to PDFDocEncoding because it makes for reliable results from strlen() function.
<li>Added \x0a after %%EOF: Ghostscript expects this, other viewers might as well. Technically it's within spec either way.
</ul>
