<h1>Reporting bugs</h1>
<p>Bug reporting is a hot topic. Please, PLEASE report bugs so I
can fix them! Please read this entire document
before submitting a bug report</p>
<p>I've gotten a number of bug reports regarding phppdflib.  Some
of them have been invaluable to improving the library. An unfortunately
high number of bug reports have been a waste of my time. Here's how
to make sure that your bug report fits into the former category.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're using the latest stable version of the library
    before reporting a bug. If your working with the development version,
    make sure your using the most recent development version. I can
    only fix each bug one time.
<li>Before contacting me, do everything in your power to ensure that
    the bug is in phppdflib and not somewhere else. Check the version
    of php that you're using. Update to the latest version of your
    viewer software. Try a different viewer. Reread the documentation
    to make sure you're using the library in the manner it was intended.
    There is more advice to heed <a href='basics.html#problems'>here</a>.
<li>If you're trying out a development version, please check the docs
    to see if what you're trying to do is supposed to work yet. The
    development versions are often released when I know very well that
    everything doesn't work right. That doesn't mean that I don't want
    to get bug reports, but it does get annoying when people constantly
    tell me things I already know. It's quite possible that the
    docs were written before the code, so don't be surprised if many
    features claim to do things that they don't. This is a difficult
    thing to do, and I understand that, just do the best you can.
    At least make an effort.
<li>When you submit the bug report, be sure to include <b>at least</b>
    the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>Version of phppdflib you're using.
        <li>Version of PHP you're using.
        <li>Make, model and version of the webserver you're
            using.
        <li>Make, model and version of the operating system
            that php/webserver is running on.
        <li>Make, model and version of PDF viewer you're using
            (include the OS that you're running it on).
        <li>Make, model and version of the browser that you're using
            (again, include the OS).
        <li>An exact copy of the error message.
        <li>If a PDF is created, but won't display, I need a copy
            of what was created.
        <li>A copy of the script that is causing the error (if
            one of the supplied example scripts is failing, it's
            enough to tell me which one)
    </ul>
    If you do not provide this information, you will get an email from
    me asking for it. I still want to fix the bug, I simply <b>can't</b>
    do it without the information above.
<li>After you've submitted your bug, and I send a reply to you asking
    you for more information or to try something, <b>reply to me</b>.
    I understand that not everyone has time or is able to reinstall
    their viewer software, but at least send me an email to tell
    me that you won't be able to do what I've asked, so I don't
    wonder if you're dead.
<li>Bug reports and tutoring sessions are not the same thing. I would
    honestly love to teach everyone how to write php scripts, if you
    are willing to pay my hourly rate, I will spend as much time with
    you as you need. Otherwise, please don't email me with basic
    questions about php if you aren't willing to read the extensive
    and well-written documentation on php's web site as well as what
    I've written here.
<li>If you can't or aren't willing to do 1 through 5, <b>don't submit
    a bug report</b>. It's not that I don't care about the bug you
    found, it's just that <b>I can't do anything about it unless you
    do 1 through 5</b>.
</ol>
<p>Let me tell you a little about me. I'm crazy WRT bugs. I hate
them. I lie awake at night wondering why my code isn't perfect.</p>
<p>If you send me an incomplete bug report and refuse to answer
my followups, I will go crazy. I'll email you every day until I
get a response (don't think I'll forget, I'll write a cron job
to do it for me). I'll crack into government databases to find
out everything about you and show up at your front door or place
of employment with a clipboard in my hand. I'll camp out in your
back yard (I have a Coleman stove, don't think I'm not serious!)
I'll crack into your computer and gather the information myself,
and while I'm at it,
I'll email your significant other all your porn. I'll call you
at odd hours of the night (what time is it in Europe right now
anyway?) I'll show up at social gatherings and
embarrass you by asking for the information while you're trying
to impress others with funny stories. I'm not stable. The only
thing that keeps me in check is when bugs get fixed.</p>
<p>If that last paragraph didn't frighten you, then you probably
have a good bug report to submit. Please send it to
<a href='mailto:wmoran@potentialtech.com'>wmoran@potentialtech.com</a>.
I'll usually reply within a few days.</p>
