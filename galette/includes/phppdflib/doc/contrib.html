<h1>Contributers</h1>
<p>Since we started work on this library, many have contributed
to its success. If we missed your name on this list, please don't
be shy: remind us. Things get pretty hectic sometimes and it's
easy to forget to add someone's name to this list. Send me an
email to remind me that you helped and I'll add your name here.
I firmly believe in giving credit where it is due!</p>
