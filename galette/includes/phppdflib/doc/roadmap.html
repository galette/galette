<H1>Version 3 roadmap</H1>
<P>Some things we're considering for version 3 (once the goals for
version 2 are met):</P>
<UL>
	<LI>A class-wide layout engine that
	    will track the available space on the page, and create new pages as
	    needed. 
	<LI>A mechanism for creating headers/footers and other elements
	    that are consistent on all pages.
	<LI>A mechanism to create PDF tables of contents.
	<LI>Embedding of external font files.
	<li>Links within the document
	<li>Links to external documents
	<li>Fill-in forms
	<li>An extension that adds effects (specifically: gradient fill.
	    others are possible ... ideas?)
    <li>PDF encryption
    <li>Different linetypes (dashed, dotted, etc)
</UL>
<P>If you have ideas for features you'd like to see in the library,
please let us know so we can add them to the wish list. We'll be
using this wish list to create the target document for version 3,
once version 2 is in release status.</P>
